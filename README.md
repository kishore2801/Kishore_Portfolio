# Kishore_Portfolio


<p>
My portfolio will show all the data science projects with their source code. MY portfolio will show the insights and finding of my projects that I found interesting or important in the project. The project will be a recreation which made on data science projects that are available online.

The intensity of project will start from the level of beginner to Advanced level for each data science project the level will be shown in the heading itself. This Data science portfolio is used for tracking my Progress in my goals. The dataset will be collected form different datasources and analysis will be conducted and models will be developed to predict the dependent variable using independent variables.

## [Project 1:Predicting the types of Flower based on the attributes of the Flowers](https://github.com/kishore2801/Data-science-Projects/blob/main/Iris%20Data/Iris.ipynb)

**Iris Data Analysis and Model Development**

The Iris dataset was used in R.A. Fisher's classic 1936 paper, The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems, and can also be found on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are Id, SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm, Species

In this analysis we are going to use Logistic Regression, SVM and Decision Tree classification.

This is probably the most versatile, easy and resourceful dataset in pattern recognition literature. Nothing could be simpler than the Iris dataset to learn classification techniques. If you are totally new to data science, this is your start line. The data has only 150 rows & 4 columns.

**Problem: Predict the class of the flower based on available attributes.**

**Results:**

As per the Test Accuracy we can see that SVM classification is considered as better solution since the test accuracy is 100% of therefore SVM classification is a better model for the dataframe.
